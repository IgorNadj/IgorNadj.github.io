Hi and thank you for taking the time out to visit this page -

I'm hoping the following will help both of us save a little bit of time:

- I'm broadly interested in Engineering / Technical leadership roles, mostly on the backend.

- 

- Alternatively, I may consider hands-on programming projects in the "Front-end" space; Web or Mobile Apps.


- I'm available for 4-days a week, generally Mon - Thu.


- I prefer remote roles, working on greenfield projects.
