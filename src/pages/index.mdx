# Igor Nadj
Hi! I'm a Software Engineer based in Naarm / Melbourne, on the tools since 2010. I found programming in high school making fun little flash games, and it's been a journey ever since!

Outside of tech, I'm a little bit obsessed with ultralight hiking and film photography, otherwise you'll run into me on a jog, swimming, at the local tennis courts or bouldering gym.
