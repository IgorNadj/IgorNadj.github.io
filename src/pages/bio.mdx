## Bio

I've always enjoyed making things, and making people's lives easier with tech. I'm a big believer in tools that feel invisible -- get the job done and get out of the way, giving us more time to enjoy the people and things we love.

### Top 4 principles:
- Clean Code
- KISS
- Faster builds
- The best code is no code
